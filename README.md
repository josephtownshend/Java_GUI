# Java_GUI
### A quick experiment in creating GUIs with Java Swing.
 
 #### Notes
 - Having a hard time getting the layout to work how I was, there looks like there is a few options for this so will continue to explore.
 - Would like to refactor to remove everything from constructor and put it into main.
